Today I have some good news to share with everyone: our Pysio NetWorks Team (AS213605) has officially become a MANRS member!

## What is MANRS?

Simply put, MANRS is a globally agreed-upon routing security standard in the internet community. Joining it means we're doing well in network security and routing management, and we're willing to work with global peers to make the internet safer.

## The Joining Process

The application process was quite ceremonial. We submitted various materials and improved many security details. Finally, the official review passed and gave us a "qualified" stamp, mainly passing these aspects:

- Not spreading incorrect routing information
- Being able to communicate and coordinate with global peers when problems arise
- Making routing information as open and transparent as possible

## What Does This Mean?

Our AS number 213605 can now be found on the MANRS official website: [Click here to see our homepage](https://manrs.org/participant/6567/). We'll also receive monthly compliance reports from the official team to see if we've regressed or improved.

## Some Thoughts

Being able to become a MANRS member means our efforts have been recognized, and it's also an affirmation of our team's technical skills and sense of responsibility. In the future, we'll continue to do well in network security, and we welcome everyone to communicate with us more and improve together!

If you're interested in MANRS or have any ideas, feel free to leave a comment or message us!

## "Perfect IP" Performance Art

Let's talk about something interesting! We recently did a "Perfect IP" performance art project where four people dialed together to piece together a complete IP address, symbolizing teamwork and the wonderful connection of the network world.
