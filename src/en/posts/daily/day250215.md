Haven't written articles for a while, so let me write one to record what I've been doing ;P

## AnyCast Network

At the beginning of last month, I applied for an ASN. After getting a /44 IPv6 address segment, I started tinkering with BGP and eventually built an Anycast network to play with (mainland China access speed is quite touching)

As of February 15, 2025, Anycast has 6 nodes

Currently, the blog is also distributed through this network ~~(but actually mainland China access has a layer of Tencent Cloud CDN)~~ 

At the same time, to distinguish which server returned the response when accessing, I added a popup and a footer so you can tell which node you got the response from ~~and also see what strange place you got thrown to~~

## File Distribution Refactoring

Previously, I was using Yanmu's 93@Home as the file distribution server, but due to some ridiculous issues and the problem that some clients don't accept 302 redirects, I ended up writing my own file distribution service and storing files on Minio...

## Blog API Refactoring

uhhh The previous API was always using TypeScript + Node.js, but due to small server performance issues and multithreading nonsense, I finally switched to GO =- = It was unavoidable QWQ

## New Comment System

The previous comment system was always based on GitHub and also had no view count statistics, so I simply switched to Waline but removed the reaction part (felt it was really ugly)
