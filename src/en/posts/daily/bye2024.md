It's time for the annual New Year's celebration again (what nonsense), time to do the year-end summary.

As for what I did this year, uh... I'll come back to write more details between March 3-10, haha. For now, I'm going to sleep first!

EDIT: Definitely not being lazy meow uwu (x Let me put a GitHub stats chart below first uwu)
