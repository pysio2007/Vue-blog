I was bored today and did a ping

I was wondering why it would resolve to this [IP](https://106.74.25.198/), until I visited it.

Uh, this is somewhat outrageous. I don't know what law I violated to be thrown in there...

Let's see first. If it gets blocked on a large scale, I'll need to consider how to appeal...

### Edit 2023-12-26:

Called the local 96110 to appeal against the blocking, they told me to wait

One day later, Chongqing 96110 told me the domain was whitelisted and the website won't redirect to the anti-fraud center anymore
