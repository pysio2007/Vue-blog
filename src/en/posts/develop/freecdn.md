This blog provides a free domestic CDN. You can get access by leaving a contact method in the comments/contacting me/creating a new [Issue](https://github.com/pysio2007/Vue-blog).

> [!tip]
> You need to ensure that your website does not violate the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China, and does not contain pornography, gambling, drugs (drug overdose), violence and other content.

The CDN only provides 1GB of traffic per day for a single website. Access will be prohibited after exceeding the limit. (Can be extended with reasonable justification)

The CDN does not support HTTP3/WebSocket.

We will conduct regular inspections to check the content of your website. If we find anything that violates the laws of the People's Republic of China, we will unilaterally stop the resolution.
